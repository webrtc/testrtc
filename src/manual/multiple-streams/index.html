  <p>This page will open a getUserMedia stream for each audio device avaliable upon load, selecting start call will then setup two peerconnections and add an audio element per stream along with a attach and remove stream button. This allows the user to attach each stream to an audio element.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this page is to be able to demonstrate how Chrome and WebRTC does getUserMedia stream mixing when rendered in a single or multiple audio tag(s).</p>
  <p>Information will be sent to javascript console, open it for details.</p>
